# Grid-Integration
Renewable Energy and EV Network data Integration.

## Renewable energy source and EV network data integration

- PV Data: National Renewable Energy Laboratory
- EV Netwoerk: Open Charge Map
   
## Observations for the 7 days analysis:
- Energy production tends to peak around 10am - 11am in the morning
- Over the 7days, '319_PV_1' has consistantly produced the highest energy amount. 
- The Highest PowerKW a charging station has in the EV network is 351KW
## Conlusion:

- Although we are missing demand data from the EV netork to optimize how energy is supplied to each charging location, we can conlcude that the data indicates a strong potential for a sustainable and economically viable integration of the PV site with the EV charging station.
- When Optimized, the EV charging could operate autonomously from the grid, making use of some battery infrastructure for emergency or unforseen situation.
